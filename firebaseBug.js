The Firebase SDK's `onAuthStateChanged` listener might not trigger when the user's authentication status changes due to a race condition or improper listener attachment. This can occur if the listener is attached or detached too early or late in the application's lifecycle, leading to missed authentication state updates.  Another issue can be related to unhandled promise rejections in asynchronous operations that interact with Firebase Authentication.
