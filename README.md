# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Listener Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with the Firebase `onAuthStateChanged` listener not always firing when the authentication status changes.  This can lead to unexpected behavior in your application if not handled properly. The `firebaseBug.js` file showcases the problem scenario, while `firebaseBugSolution.js` presents a robust solution using improved listener management and promise handling.

## Problem

In certain cases, particularly those involving asynchronous operations and rapid changes in authentication status, the `onAuthStateChanged` listener might miss events. This is often due to a race condition where the listener is attached or detached before or after authentication changes occur.  Failure to handle promise rejections also contributes.

## Solution

The provided solution focuses on the following:

* **Ensuring proper listener attachment:** The listener is carefully attached within the initialization flow to avoid potential race conditions.
* **Robust error handling:**  The solution incorporates robust error handling using `.catch` for promises to prevent silent failures that could mask authentication issues.
* **Using async/await:**  This enhances code clarity and aids in managing asynchronous operations.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have the Firebase JavaScript SDK installed (`npm install firebase`).
3. Configure your Firebase project and update the `firebaseConfig` object in `firebaseBug.js` and `firebaseBugSolution.js`.
4. Run `firebaseBug.js` to observe the problem, then `firebaseBugSolution.js` to see how to correct it.
